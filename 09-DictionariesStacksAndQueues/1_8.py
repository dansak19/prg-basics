# The data below contains a price list of items from a clothing store along with their prices.
#  Due to a seasonal sale, the store is reducing the price of each item by 10%. Write a program that:

# prints a list of products and their prices before the discount
# prints the total value of the products before the discount
# modifies the price list according to the discount (round prices to two decimal places)
# prints a list of products and their prices after the 10% discount
# prints the total value of the products after the discount
